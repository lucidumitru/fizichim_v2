## II.1.1. Physical parameter.


Nature is made up of bodies. The bank, the blackboard, the book, the notebook, the stones, the Earth, the Moon, the Sun, the houses, the cars etc. **they are all bodies.**

The man perceives bodies in nature with the help of his senses, due to the properties (properties) they have.



<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/2_11_1_SimturileOmului.jpg" width="1000" height="129" lazy={false} />


<br></br>
<br></br>


**We see** the color of the bodies, their state of aggregation, their shape, transparency, etc.

**We smell** the scent of flowers, milk, vinegar and we recognize certain substances by their smell.

**We touch** the objects in a dark room so as not to hit ourselves or the radiator in winter, to feel the heat given by it.

**We taste** sweet chocolate, bitter wormwood, sometimes too salty foods, hot peppers.

**We hear** the boiling of water as it begins to boil, the chirping of birds, the ticking of the clock.

### II.1.1.1. Physical properties.

:::important Definition

The properties of bodies such as: shape, color, state of aggregation, smell, spatial extent, state of heating, are called **physical properties.**

:::


<br></br>


### II.1.1.2. Particular properties.

:::important Definition

Bodies differ from each other by certain properties, which are characteristic of them, called **particular properties.**

:::

**Example:**

**The water in a cup is:**

- liquid;
- tasteless (lacking flavour);
- odorless (having no odor);
- colorless (uncolored);
- transparent (we see through it);
- takes the shape of the vessel etc.

<br></br>
<br></br>





**Milk from a cup is:**

- a liquid;
- with sweet taste;
- specific smell of milk;
- white color;
- opaque (we do not see through it);
- takes the shape of the vessel.

<br></br>


### II.1.1.3. General Properties.


:::important Definition

There is another category of properties that all bodies in nature have, called **general properties.**



:::


**Examples of the general properties of bodies:**

#### II.1.1.3.1. Bodies are made up of substances. These include::

- **natural substances** (oxygen, nitrogen, water, oil, coal, diamond, gold, salt etc.);
- **artificial substances** (glass, plastic, petrol, diesel, iron, aluminum, chemical fertilizers etc.).


:::note Remark

**When you call a body I think:**

- a certain **shape** and
- a certain **volume** of it.

**When naming a substance I can think of:**

- different **forms** that it can take in different **bodies.**

For example, when I say **nail** I call a **body** (I think of the well-known shape of the nail), and when I say **iron** I name a **substance** (iron can take the shape of a nail, cabinet, wire etc.).

Also, **water** in a bottle refers to a **body** (the shape of the bottle), and **water** refers to a substance (water in a bottle, a glass, a lake etc.).



:::



#### II.1.1.3.2. Bodies occupy a space called volume.


#### II.1.1.3.3. The bodies may be in one of the states of aggregation:

- **solid**: own shape and own volume;

- **liquid**: it does not have its own shape (it takes the shape of a vessel) and its own volume (ie 1 Liter of water from a bottle, it also occupies 1 liter in a 10L pot);

- **gaseous**: it has no shape of its own (it takes the shape of a vessel) nor its own volume (it occupies the entire volume provided).




<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/2_11_33_1_StarileDeAgregare.jpg" width="1000" height="240" />


<br></br>
<br></br>


### II.1.1.4. Classification and ordering.

To understand the notion of physical size, we must first clarify two notions, namely: **classification** and **ordering**.


:::important Definition

**To classify** the bodies of a set means to divide them into groups (classes), according to a certain classification criterion (a property common to all the bodies in that set).

:::

**Example of classifications:**

- Students in a class can be classified **by height** into three groups:
  - Group of short students;
  - Group of students with average height and
  - Group of tall students.

- The bodies in the image from the aggregation states: ice cube, water from a cup and locomotive smoke can be classified, according to the state of aggregation, in three groups:
  - **Solids** (ice cube);
  - **Liquids** (cup water) and
  - **Gaseous** (locomotive smoke).

 
 
:::important Definition

**To order** the bodies of a set means to arrange them in ascending / descending order on the basis of an ordering criterion (a property common to all the bodies in that set).

:::


**Examples of ordering:**

- In sports class, students are ordered in ascending order of height.
- If we wanted to order the 3 bodies in the image from the aggregation states: ice cube, water from a cup and locomotive smoke we will not be able to do it, as we will not find any ordering criteria, because they have no property common after which we could arrange them ascending.
- Look at the three cylindrical glasses. By what criteria could you order them? <Img className="img-responsive5" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/2_11_40_1_3Pahare.jpg" width="1000" height="702" />


<br></br>

  - If you _order by height_ (denoted by h) you get exact arranging in ascending order as shown below: ```h1 < h2 < h3```. <Img className="img-responsive5" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/2_11_40_2_3PahareOrdonateDupaInaltime.jpg" width="1000" height="698" />

<br></br>

  - If you _order them by diameter_ (denoted by D) you would get the arrangement in ascending order exactly as in the image below: ```D1 < D2 < D3``` (the **diameter of a circle** represents any segment that has as ends two points on the circle and passes through the center of the circle).  <Img className="img-responsive5" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/2_11_40_3_3PahareOrdonateDupaDiametru.jpg" width="1000" height="527" />

<br></br>


### II.1.1.5. Classification of physical properties according to the ordering criterion. Measurable physical properties.


Depending on the ordering criteria, there are two categories of physical properties:

a) **properties that can be sorting criteria**, for example: length, height, diameter, surface area, body volume, event time, temperature, weight, etc.

b) **properties that cannot be sorting criteria**, for example: state of aggregation, color, smell of a body, taste of a food, shape of a body. We cannot make a quantitative comparison (greater or lesser) between these properties of bodies. What greater or lesser relationship should I put between red and blue?

Of these two categories, only the physical properties that constitute ordering criteria are **measurable properties**. They allow their quantitative comparison with other properties of the same kind, ie they can be measured. These are the properties that interest physicists and that will be studied by you during physics classes.




:::important Definition

**The measurable physical properties** of a body are those properties that can be measured with a device and with which bodies can be ordered.


:::


#### Exemple de proprietăți fizice măsurabile:


**Examples of measurable physical properties:**

- the length of the table measured with the ruler is 90 cm;
- the class time measured with the clock is 50 minutes;
- the volume of glass water measured with graduated vessels is 2 L.

**Measurable physical properties** have been associated with **physical parameters**. E.g :

- The one-way spatial extent has been associated with the physical parameter called **length**.
- The two-way spatial extent has been associated with the physical parameter called **area**.
- The spatial extent in all three directions (or the place occupied by the body in space) has been associated with the physical parameter called **volume**.
- Time interval of an event = **duration**.
- Intensity of interaction between two bodies = **force**.
- The heating state of a body = **temperature**.


 
<br></br>


 










### II.1.1.6. Measurement of physical parameter.


**The measurement of a physical parameter** involves its quantitative comparison with the chosen unit of measurement (also called standard).

**The measurement of a physical parameter** is done with the help of an appropriate measuring instrument.

**Physical parameter** and the **measurement unit** corresponding to this measure the same property.



**Example:**

- the meter is a length;
- the second is a time interval etc.



**Physical parameters** are denoted by **symbols**.



**Example:**

- the symbol used for distance is d;
- the symbol for area is A;
- the symbol for time is t etc.





:::important Definition

**To measure a physical parameter** means to compare it with another quantity of the same nature, chosen as a unit of measurement.

:::



**Example. To measure the length of the table, denoted by l I used:**
- Unit of measurement (standard): cm;
- Measuring instrument: ruler;
- Measurement procedure: comparison;
- The result of the measurement is: l = 90 cm (the length of the table has the numerical value 90, and the chosen unit of measurement was the centimeter).




| **The result of measuring a physical quantity is given in the following form:**|
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|**PHYSICAL PARAMETER (SYMBOL) = NUMERICAL VALUE ∙ UNIT OF MEASUREMENT (SYMBOL)** |


<br></br>

### II.1.1.7. Setting the unit of measurement.


**The establishment of units of measurement** is done through international conventions.

At the international level it was agreed to have a unique system of quantities and units of measurement, called **the International System of Sizes and Units** (the abbreviation being **SI**). It has been applied in Romania since 1960.

**To express that the unit of length in the SI meter we write:**



<Img className="img-responsive" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/2_11_70_1_UnitateaDeMasuraALungimii.jpg" width="1000" height="60" />



and it reads **the unit of measurement for length in the International System is the meter**.


**To express that the unit of time in SI is the second we write:**
 
 
<Img className="img-responsive" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/2_11_70_1_UnitateaDeMasuraATimpului.jpg" width="1000" height="60" /> 


and it reads **the unit of measurement for time in the International System is the second**.



:::note Remark

During the study of physics you will learn many physical parameters and their units in SI. You also need to know the values of multiples and submultiples that apply to all units of measurement. In addition to those that are basic, there are other larger multiples, or other smaller submultiples.


:::

<br></br>

### II.1.1.8. Multiples of units of measure.

**Multiples of units of measure** - are greater than that unit whenever their value show:



<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/2_11_90_1_MultipliiUnitatilorMasura_vers2.jpg" width="1000" height="138" />

<br></br>
<br></br>

### II.1.1.9. Submultiples of units of measurement. 

**Submultiples of units of measure** - are smaller than that unit whenever their value show:

<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/2_11_90_2_SubmultipliiUnitatilorMasura_vers2.jpg" width="1000" height="247" />




:::note Remark

When we have to transform from a submultiple or multiple to the base unit, we copy the given value, then instead of the symbol of the multiple or submultiple we replace its value (preferably as a fraction, in submultiples) and copy the remaining unit (see the examples in the table) .

Remember, when we have a number multiplied by 10, 100, 1000, etc., the comma of the number moves to the right over as many digits as we have zeros.

:::


**Exemplu:**
0,7 ∙ 1000, we move the comma to the right over 3 digits and in the free places we put zero.


<Img className="img-responsive" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/2_11_90_3_MutareVirgulaSpreDreapta.jpg" width="1000" height="119" />


<br></br>
<br></br>


:::note Remark

Remember, when we have a number divided by 10, 100, 1000, etc., the comma of the number moves to the left over as many digits as we have zeros.

:::



**Exemplu:**
43/1000 we move the comma to the left over 3 digits and in the free places we put zero.

<Img className="img-responsive" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/2_11_90_4_MutareVirgulaSpreStanga.jpg" width="1000" height="143" />

<br></br>
<br></br>


### II.1.1.10. Characterization of a physical parameter.

**To characterize a physical size we need to show it:**


- **The symbol**
- **Definition or calculation formula** (there are parameters that do not have a formula and are only determined directly by measurement using a measuring instrument; for example: length, duration, temperature etc.)
- **Units of measurement** (the fundamental one or in the International System and the derived ones);
- **Measuring instruments** (there are few physical parameters for which there are no measuring instruments; they are determined only indirectly by calculation using a formula; for example: area, mechanical strength, heat etc.).


<br></br>

## II.1.2. Physical phenomena.

:::important Definition

**A physical phenomenon** (physical process) occurs when at least one of the physical properties that characterize a body changes over time.


:::


:::note Reamark

Following a physical phenomenon, the body does not change its substance.

:::


:::caution Example of physical phenomena:

- **Water boiling** (water changes its state of aggregation, from liquid to gaseous);


<Img className="img-responsive4" src="fizica/clasa6/capitolul2/2_100_2_1_FierbereaApei_vers2.jpg" width="1000" height="358" />
