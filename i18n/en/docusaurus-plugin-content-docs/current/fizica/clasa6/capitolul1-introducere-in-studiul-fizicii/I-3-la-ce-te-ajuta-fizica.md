:::note Remark

Physics helps you:

- **to understand the phenomena around you** (visible or invisible);
- **to learn logically** (not mechanically, like a parrot);
- **to gather information** with the help of your senses or tools;
- **draw certain conclusions** based on the information gathered;
- **to extract the essentials** from a certain informative material.

In other words, **Physics makes you smarter**!
