**Without you claim that you are a scientist and still think you're curious answer many mysteries observed in everyday life:**


- How does water circulate in nature and why does it rain in summer and snow in winter?
- How is the rainbow formed?
- Why does the plastic deform when we fill a bottle with water and put it in the freezer?
- Why is the sky blue during the day and black at night?
- How big is the universe?
- How long will our Sun live?
- Why do bodies left free fall?
- How can planes fly?
- How can very heavy ships float on the water?
- What is lightning and thunder?

Do you have any more questions? Do you think you've exhausted them?

Surely you have a lot of questions that you are looking forward to answering!
