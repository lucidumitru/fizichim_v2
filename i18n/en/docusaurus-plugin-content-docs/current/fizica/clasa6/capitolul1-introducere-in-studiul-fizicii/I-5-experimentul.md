It serves simultaneously both as a source of knowledge and as a method of learning. To experiment means to intentionally provoke certain phenomena, under certain conditions, for their study and the laws that govern them.

Observation and measurement are fundamental activities in physics. Starting from the observation of some natural phenomena, laboratory experiments are performed, in which measurements are made in order to find the physical laws and mathematical formulas that govern the studied phenomenon.
