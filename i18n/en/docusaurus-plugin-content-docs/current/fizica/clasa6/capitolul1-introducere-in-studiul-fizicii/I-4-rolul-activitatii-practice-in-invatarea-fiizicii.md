:::note Remark

**Practical activity** is one of the main tools of human knowledge and it is natural that in **learning physics, science par excellence experimental**, it provides the most appropriate evidence to substantiate the theory.

Learning physics through experimental activity will be the most challenging and interactive way, producing a permanent incentive and an attitude towards the content of the lessons, not just a passive assimilation of knowledge.
