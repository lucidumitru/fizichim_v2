:::important Water composition and structure


Water is a chemical compound of hydrogen and oxygen, having the chemical formula H<sub>2</sub>O. Hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 105 degrees, through a covalent bond. Between several water molecules, hydrogen atoms are linked to those of oxygen much weaker than those inside a single molecule (20 times weaker), through a _hydrogen bond_.
